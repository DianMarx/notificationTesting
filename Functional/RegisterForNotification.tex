We found the following problems with regards to the "Register for Notification" use case of the module.
\subsubsection*{Notification A}
The notification module for team A had the following violations
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pre condition violations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Team A provided no checks for pre-conditions.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Data structure requirement violations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item None found.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Notification B}
The notification module for team B had the following violations
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pre condition violations:
    \begin{itemize}
         \item None found.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Data structure requirement violations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item None found.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Remarks}
Team A provided no checks for pre-conditions  before writing data to the database, in every case the function returns with a value of true, making it appear to succeed even when there was no data written to the database at all, and thus no registration actually happened.\newline
Team B had no pre-condition violations. Any data that violated pre-conditions was correctly checked for and handled, registration of the user is only made if all the pre-conditions are successfully met.
