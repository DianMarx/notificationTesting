# Repositories of the Notification Modules 
1. (Notification A)[__Add Link here__] 
2. [Notification B](https://github.com/BuzzSpaceB/Notification])

# Who does what (for  A and B )
1. Functional Testing
	- Mr. Russell -> Register for Notification Use Case
	- Ms. Lessev -> Deregister for Notification Use Case
	- Mr. Kirker -> Send message Use Case
2. Non-functional testing
	- Mr. Marx -> Performance
	- Mr. Naude -> Scalability
	- Mr. Tavares -> Maintainability
	- Mr. Engelke -> Reliability
	- Mr. Potgieter -> Integrability
	- Mr. Austin -> Usability
3. Mr Fullard -> check for errors, consistency, spelling , correctness, compile and upload 

# Templates

```tex
We found the following problems with regards to the ''USE CASE NAME'' use case of the module.

	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Remarks}
Neither of the teams did what was required in the functional requirements. Some functionality reflected what was implied ... bla bla blas write something here if you deem it necessary
