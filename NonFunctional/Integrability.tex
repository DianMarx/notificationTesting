The system should be able to easily address future integration requirements by providing access to its services using widely adopted public standards.
\subsubsection*{Integratability A}
Notification A is not integratable beacuse of the following reasons.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Installing required Packages.}
	There is no way of installing the required packages. This degrades the qualitly of the integratability of the system as one has to manually figure out which packages to include in the system.
	\item \textbf{Dependancy Injection}
	There is no dependacy injection.
	\item \textbf{Unit tests}
	There was no supplied unit test. Unit test are xritical to determin wheater or not we can integrate it into a lager system.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Integratability B}
Notification B is not integratable beacuse of the following reasons.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{File Structure} 
	Each function is placed in a seperate file. There is no common module to integrate that will allow access to all the capabilities of notifications.
	\item \textbf{Installing required packages}
	One cannot easily install the dependancys that is required by Notifications.
	\item \textbf{Dependancy Injection.}
	There is no dependacy injection.
	\item \textbf{Unit tests} There is a file called test.js that is an attempt at unit testing but no proper unit testing was applied. They should have used someting similar to Unit.js.

	\item database issues
	There is no way to access the specified database and this also contributes to the integratability. They sould supply a way to specifiy the database to be used.

		\end{figure}
Both modules suffer from common syntoms when it comes to Integratability. I therfore conclude that neither system is integratable and needs to look ad dependancy injection. Each package should atleast include a npm readme file to specifiy the packages are required.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Remarks}
Notification B is not Integratable at alll. There is no provision for dependacny injection.
